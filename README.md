Ex-1 Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models.

Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

  1. Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI, Generative Model and it's types.
  2. 2024 AI tools.
  3. Explain what an LLM is and how it is built.
  4. Create a Timeline Chart for defining the Evolution of AI
     
Algorithm:

Step 1: Define Scope and Objectives
  1.1 Identify the goal of the report (e.g., educational, research, tech overview)

  1.2 Set the target audience level (e.g., students, professionals)

  1.3 Draft a list of core topics to cover

Step 2: Create Report Skeleton/Structure

  2.1 Title Page

  2.2 Abstract or Executive Summary

  2.3 Table of Contents

  2.4 Introduction

  2.5 Main Body Sections:

  • Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

  • What is Generative AI?

  • Types of Generative AI Models (e.g., GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models)

  • Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

  • Architecture of LLMs (e.g., Transformer, GPT, BERT)

  • Training Process and Data Requirements

  • Use Cases and Applications (Chatbots, Content Generation, etc.)

  • Limitations and Ethical Considerations

  • Future Trends

2.6 Conclusion
